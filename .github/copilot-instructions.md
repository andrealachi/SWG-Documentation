# Copilot instructions — SWG-Documentation

Short, actionable guidance for AI coding/content agents editing this repository.

- **Purpose:** this repository is a collection of documentation and templates organized in folders (`Documentation/`, `Folder 02/`, `Folder01/`). Current content is Markdown-only; there are no visible build scripts or application sources.

- **Big picture / why:** the repo stores docs and templates for internal use. Preserve folder structure and filenames; avoid adding executable code or CI without explicit approval.

- **Key files / locations:**
  - `Folder 02/Readme.md` — minimal README example currently present.

- **Observable conventions:**
  - Markdown files with H1 titles followed by short sections and bullet lists.
  - Prefer clear, concise Italian or English depending on owner preference; default to English when asked.
  - Avoid inline HTML unless necessary for embedding.

- **Safe actions for an AI agent:**
  - Create or update README and documentation Markdown files.
  - Add a simple index file under `Documentation/` when adding multiple docs.
  - Do NOT add dependencies, build scripts, CI workflows, or executable source files without explicit permission.
  - For structural changes (rename/move folders), include a short rationale in the commit message.

- **Project-specific examples:**
  - Expanding `Folder 02/Readme.md`: keep H1 title, add sections like "Overview", "Usage", "Files", and short bullet points.
  - New doc addition: create `Documentation/index.md` and link new files from there.

- **Questions to ask before making non-trivial changes:**
  1. Preferred language for new content (EN or IT).
  2. Is adding runnable examples or code acceptable?
  3. Should documents include YAML frontmatter or a company template?

- **Do not invent details:**
  - Avoid fabricating build commands, endpoints, or deployment instructions unless they appear elsewhere in the repo or the user provides them.

- **Suggested commit message style:**
  - `docs: add expanded README for Folder 02`

If this English version looks good, I can either:
- apply the new README template across the repository, or
- first collect your preferences (language, templates, inclusion of code examples).

Please confirm which action you prefer.

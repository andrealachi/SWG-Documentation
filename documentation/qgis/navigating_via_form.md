# Navigating GeoPackage Tables via Forms

You can explore the GeoPackage tables using forms.

The relationships defined between the tables enable the display of subforms for related records: to show them, expand the corresponding section by clicking the icon ①.
Navigation can proceed through additional related layers by further expanding the nested forms ②.

When there are many relationships and the available screen space is limited (depending on your monitor's resolution), some content may not be fully displayed ③. 

In these cases, it is recommended to:
Collapse unnecessary sections ④ to free up vertical space.
Reduce the width of the left panel (the one showing the list of records) by dragging the divider ⑤, thus reclaiming horizontal space and improving field readability.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This means you can safely distribute the project, and **users will be able to [open it](./open_geopackage.md) without installing the plugin**, because the updated paths are already embedded in the project itself.

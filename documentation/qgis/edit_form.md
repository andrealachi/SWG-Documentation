# Editing Records Through a QGIS Form

>To create or modify a record through a QGIS form, you must enable editing mode by using the <img src="../assets/pencil.webp"> **"Toggle Editing Mode"** button. 

## Start Editing

This button is available both in the QGIS <strong>Digitizing toolbar</strong> ① and in the <strong>context menu</strong> of each layer ②.

In addition, the same button—along with other tools useful for editing—is also available directly <strong>inside the forms</strong> ③ and within the <strong>sub‑forms</strong> ④.  
</p>
<br clear="all"><br>

This setup allows for faster and more complete editing of all elements that make up the GeoPackage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **“Toggle Editing Mode”** button in the main **Digitizing** toolbar enables editing for the layer that is currently selected in the Layers panel.

## Edit mode
After the **Toggle Editing Mode** button is clicked, the form enters **editing mode**.

<p>

       alt="Fig.1" align="left" width="500">
The toggle button remains in the <strong>checked (pressed) state</strong> ⑤ ⑥ to indicate that editing is enabled, and a <strong>pencil icon</strong> ⑦ appears in the <strong>Layers</strong>panel next to the layer currently being edited.

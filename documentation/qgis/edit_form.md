This button is available both in the QGIS <strong>Digitizing toolbar</strong> ① and in the <strong>context menu</strong> of each layer ②.

In addition, the same button—along with other tools useful for editing—is also available directly <strong>inside the forms</strong> ③ and within the <strong>sub‑forms</strong> ④.

This setup allows for faster and more complete editing of all elements that make up the GeoPackage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **“Toggle Editing Mode”** button in the main **Digitizing** toolbar enables editing for the layer that is currently selected in the Layers panel.

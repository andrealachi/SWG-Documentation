>To create or modify a record through a QGIS form, you must enable editing mode by using the **“Toggle Editing Mode”** button.

This button is available both in the QGIS **“Digitizing” toolbar** ① and in the **context menu** of each layer ②.

In addition, the same button—along with other tools useful for editing—is also available directly **inside the forms** ③ and within the **sub‑forms** ④.

This setup allows for faster and more complete editing of all elements that make up the GeoPackage.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **“Toggle Editing Mode”** button in the main **Digitizing** toolbar enables editing for the layer that is currently selected in the Layers panel.

## Table: `observation`

### Columns

| Name | Type | Constraints | Description |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | `INTEGER` | PRIMARY KEY | A unique, read-only attribute that serves as an identifier for the entity. |
| `guid` | `TEXT` |  | Universally unique identifier. |
| `phenomenontime_start` | `DATETIME` | NOT NULL, DEFAULT strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', 'now') | The time instant when the Observation happens, or the start time if it happens over a period. |
| `phenomenontime_end` | `DATETIME` |  | The end time if the Observation happens over a period. |
| `result_text` | `TEXT` |  | The estimated value of an ObservedProperty from the Observation, when the Type is Category or Text. |
| `result_real` | `REAL` |  | The estimated value of an ObservedProperty from the Observation, when the Type is Quantity or Count. |
| `result_boolean` | `BOOLEAN` |  | The estimated value of an ObservedProperty from the Observation, when the Type is Boolean. |
| `resulttime` | `DATETIME` |  | The time of the Observation’s result was generated. |
| `validtime_start` | `DATETIME` |  | The start time of the period during which the result may be used. |
| `validtime_end` | `DATETIME` |  | The end time of the period during which the result may be used. |
| `properties` | `TEXT` |  | mime type: 'application/json'. A JSON Object containing user-annotated properties as key-value pairs. |
| `guid_datastream` | `TEXT` | NOT NULL | Foreign key to the Datstream table, guid field. |


### Table Identifiers
In this table, the primary key is the *id* field (integer, auto-incrementing).  
There is also a text field named **GUID**, which stores a *UUID* (Universally Unique Identifier) compliant with RFC 4122.

Although GUID is not mandatory at the schema level (it is not declared NOT NULL), its functional requirement is enforced by two triggers:
- **observationguid (INSERT)** trigger: if GUID is missing or empty, a correctly formatted UUID is generated and inserted automatically.
- **observationguidupdate (UPDATE)** trigger: prevents any modification of GUID after insertion, making it immutable (effectively behaving as a stable key).  

Any foreign keys (FK) from other tables reference this table’s GUID field rather than the id field, ensuring stable and interoperable references across datasets and database instances.


### Relationships (as child)
- `observation.guid_datastream` → `datastream.guid` (**ON UPDATE** CASCADE, **ON DELETE** CASCADE)
  - *Note:* delete on `datastream` cascades to `observation`.

### Referenced by (as parent)
- None

### Indexes

| Name | Unique | Columns | Origin | Partial |
|------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| `sqlite_autoindex_observation_2` | Yes | `phenomenontime_start`, `guid_datastream` | `u` | No |
| `sqlite_autoindex_observation_1` | Yes | `guid` | `u` | No |

### Triggers
For every trigger you will find:

- **When it runs** (BEFORE/AFTER, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- **What it reads and compares** (columns, lookups in other tables)
- **What happens on success** (the statement proceeds, optional updates)
- **What happens on failure** (the exact error text raised)

 



#### `observationguid` / `observationguidupdate`
**When they run:** AFTER INSERT / AFTER UPDATE OF `guid`

**What they do:** Assign GUID at insert when missing; prevent changes later.

**If the check passes:** Insert writes GUID; unchanged updates proceed.

**If the check fails:** On change, abort with: `Cannot update guid column.`



### Alignment of the Datastream Time Window
To maintain in `datastream` a consistent summary of the temporal coverage of its observations, there are three triggers that recompute the fields `datastream.phenomenontime_start` (MIN) and `datastream.phenomenontime_end` (MAX) with respect to all related rows in `observation`:
- `observation_ai_recalc_ds_times` (AFTER INSERT): upon a new insert, recomputes MIN/MAX on the datastream of `NEW.iddatastream`.
- `observation_au_recalc_ds_times` (AFTER UPDATE OF phenomenontime_*, iddatastream): recomputes for the new datastream; if the observation has been moved across series, it also recomputes for the old datastream.
- `observation_ad_recalc_ds_times` (AFTER DELETE): upon deletion, recomputes MIN/MAX on the datastream of `OLD.iddatastream`.

To support these recurring aggregations, recommended indexes are defined:
- `idx_observation_ds_times (iddatastream, phenomenontime_start, phenomenontime_end)`

### Result Compliance Based on `datastream.type`
Two BEFORE triggers (INSERT and UPDATE) apply expected structure and domain rules to the observation’s `result`, according to the type defined in the linked datastream row:
- `observation_bi_type_constraints` (BEFORE INSERT)
- `observation_bu_type_constraints` (BEFORE UPDATE OF result_*, iddatastream)

The rules by type are:

### Quantity
- Expected structure: only `result_real` NOT NULL; `result_text` and `result_boolean` must be NULL.
- Constraints with respect to the bounds (if configured in the datastream):
  - if `value_min` is not NULL → `result_real >= value_min`;
  - if `value_max` is not NULL → `result_real <= value_max`.

### Category
- Expected structure: only `result_text` NOT NULL; `result_real` and `result_boolean` must be NULL.
- Codelist membership: `result_text` must exist as `codelist.id` in the collection equal to `datastream.codespace` (join by collection).

### Boolean
- Expected structure: only `result_boolean` NOT NULL with value 0 or 1; `result_text` and `result_real` must be NULL.

### Count
- Expected structure: only `result_real` NOT NULL, but it must be integer in value (comparison `result_real = CAST(result_real AS INTEGER)`). `result_text` and `result_boolean` must be NULL.
- Constraints with respect to the bounds (if present in the datastream):
  - if `value_min` is not NULL → `result_real >= value_min`;
  - if `value_max` is not NULL → `result_real <= value_max`.

### Text
- Expected structure: only `result_text` NOT NULL; `result_real` and `result_boolean` must be NULL.

### Bounds Consistency Between Datastream and Observations (Related Logic)
Although they are not triggers “of the observation table,” two triggers on `datastream` ensure that any changes to `value_min`/`value_max` do not make existing observations inconsistent:
- `datastream_bu_bounds_validate_observations` (BEFORE UPDATE OF value_min, value_max) blocks the update if there exist observations (for that datastream) with `result_real` outside the new limits. Applies to types Quantity and Count.
- In addition, `datastream_bi/bu_bounds_consistency` prevent setting `value_min > value_max` when both are non-NULL.
- For Count, `datastream_bi/bu_count_bounds_are_integers` enforce that the extrema, if present, are integers in value (the “integer” form is verified with numeric cast, e.g., 3.0 is accepted).

This family therefore guarantees semantic stability: you cannot tighten a series’ admissibility interval in such a way as to “expel” measurements already acquired.

### Error Messages and Diagnosis
The triggers use `RAISE(ABORT, '...')` with specific messages (e.g., “Type Quantity: result_real is below value_min.”, “Type Category: result_text must exist in codelist...”), facilitating diagnosis during data ingestion and ETL automation.
